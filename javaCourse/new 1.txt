abstraction in java:
hiding the internal implementation and showing only those 
properties to the user which we want to show to them.


in java abstraction can be achived by two ways :

1. by using abstract class.
2. by using interface.



1.a. by using abstract class abstraction can be achived from zero to 100%.
2.a. by using interface abstraction can be achived by 100%.
